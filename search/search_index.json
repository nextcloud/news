The maximum number of items per feed that should be kept during the purging can be defined through the \u201cMaximum read count per feed\u201d setting in the admin UI or the <code>autoPurgeCount</code> value in the config. Additionally you may enable the option to also purge unread items <code>purgeUnread</code>. This is useful if your users have large amounts of unread items.
