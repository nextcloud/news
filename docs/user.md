## Feed Update Errors
If a feed fails to update eight times in a row, the interface displays a red bubble at the feed showing the number of errors since the last successful update.
When hovering the mouse pointer over the red bubble, the last error message is displayed.

## Subscribe

### Web address
The URL of the RSS feed you want to add. Make sure the URL points directly to the RSS feed or to a website that supports RSS. If the feed is not obvious, the website is searched when auto discover is enabled (see below).

### Folder
Specify a folder name to organize the feed. If you leave this field blank, the feed will be added without a folder. Use folders to group related feeds for easier navigation.

### Credentials
Provide a username and password if required for a feed. Please note that the password will be stored in plain text, meaning anyone with access to the server or database will be able to view it.

### Auto discover Feed
Check this option if you want the app to automatically detect the RSS feed from the entered URL. This is useful when youâ€™re unsure of the exact feed URL, as the system will scan the provided website for RSS links.

## Feed options

### Mark Read
Mark the feed as read.

### Pin to Top/Unpin from Top
The feed will be displayed at the top of the list.

### Default Order/Newest First/Oldest First
Sets the sorting order for displaying this feed. The default order is set in the settings.
**Note**: For technical reasons, the sorting is based on the date the article was added to the database, not the publication date.

### Enable/Disable Full Text
When enabled, articles will be fully retrieved from the website during the next fetch, instead of using the RSS feed.

### Unread/Ignore Updated
- If **Unread Updated** is selected, previously read articles will be marked as unread when updated.
- Otherwise, changes to articles will be ignored.

### Rename
Rename the feed.

### Move
Move the feed to a different location.

### Delete
Delete the feed.

Open the feed in a new tab or window.

## Settings

### Keyboard Shortcuts

### Article Feed Information
Opens a table with information about the article feeds:

- **Last update**: Time when the feed was last downloaded.

- **Next update**: Time when the next feed update will be done.
  (Only if activated in the admin settings, otherwise the regular update interval is used.)

- **Articles per update**: Maximum number of articles reached in a feed update.

- **Error Count**: Number of errors that have occurred since the last successful feed update.
  (When hovering the mouse pointer over the error count in a row, the last error message is displayed.)

### Display mode

- **Default Mode**:
  Displays the title and preview text across multiple lines per row.

- **Compact Mode**:
  Depending on the split mode, the title and preview text are displayed on a single line per row.

- **Screen Reader Mode**:
  A specialized mode optimized for text-to-speech programs (e.g., Orca).
  In this mode, visual elements are not relevant.
  **Key features**:
	- Keyboard navigation focuses on the article link when switching between articles.
	- During tab navigation, changing the article automatically selects the newly focused article.

### Split mode

- **Vertical**:
  The default three-column layout, with navigation, article list, and article displayed side by side.

- **Horizontal**:
  Navigation on the left, with the article list and article stacked vertically on the right.

- **Off**:
  A two-row layout where navigation and the article list are side by side. The selected article is displayed over the article list.

### Disable Mark Read Through Scrolling
Articles are not marked as read while scrolling.

### Show All Articles
All available articles are always displayed.

### Reverse Ordering (Oldest on Top)
Reverses the order so that older articles are displayed first.
**Note**: For technical reasons, the sorting is based on the date the article was added to the database, not the publication date.

### Disable Automatic Refresh
This option disables automatic feed synchronization with the backend, which occurs every 60 seconds.

### Abonnements (OPML)
Feed lists in OPML format can be imported and exported here. Feeds that cannot be loaded during the import will be ignored.
