# Documentation


As a developer you can interact with the News app in the following ways:

* [Use the API for syncing and updating feeds](externalapi/)
* [Write plugins](plugins/)
* [Add custom CSS for feeds](feedcss/)
* [Customize the explore section](explore/)


The News app uses [picoFeed](https://github.com/miniflux/picoFeed) for parsing feeds and full text feeds. picoFeed is a fantastic library so if you [add custom full text configurations](https://github.com/miniflux/picoFeed/blob/master/docs/grabber.markdown#how-to-write-a-grabber-rules-file) or fix bugs, please consider **contributing your changes** back to the library to help others :)
