# Documentation


As a developer you can interact with the News app in the following ways:

* [Use the API for syncing and updating feeds](externalapi/)
* [Write plugins](plugins/)
* [Add custom CSS for feeds](feedcss/)
* [Customize the explore section](explore/)


The News app uses [FeedIO](https://github.com/alexdebril/feed-io) for parsing feeds and full text feeds. FeedIO is a fantastic library so if you contribute or fix bugs, please consider **contributing your changes** back to the library to help others :)
