## Before you install/update the News app
Before you install the app do the following:
* Check that your **nextcloud/data/** directory is owned by your web server user and that it is write/readable
* Check that your installation fulfills the [requirements listed in the README section](https://github.com/nextcloud/news#dependencies)
* [Set up Nextcloud Background Jobs](https://docs.nextcloud.org/server/latest/admin_manual/configuration_server/background_jobs_configuration.html#cron) to enable feed updates.

Then proceed to install the app either from an archive (zip/tar.gz) or clone it from the repository using git

## Installing from the [app store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/news)
This is the easiest solution: Simply go the the apps page (section: "Multimedia") and enable the News app

## Installing from archive
* Go to the [Nextcloud News GitHub releases page](https://github.com/nextcloud/news/releases) and download the latest release/archive to your server
* Starting with 8.0.0, there are two different releases: **news.tar.gz** and **Source code**. The first one requires no additional steps, the second one requires you to install the dependencies and compile the JavaScript. Choose the first one if you don't want to work on the code. If you want to install a version prior to 8.0.0, choose the **Source code** download.
* On your server, check if there is a folder called **nextcloud/apps/news**. If there is one, delete it.
* Extract the downloaded archive to the **nextcloud/apps/** folder.
* Remove the version from the extracted folder (e.g. rename **nextcloud/apps/news-4.0.3/** to **nextcloud/apps/news/**
* If you are a version greater than or equal to 8.0.0 and downloaded the **Source code** zip or tar.gz, you need to install the JavaScript and PHP dependencies and compile the JavaScript first. On your terminal, change into the **nextcloud/apps/news/** directory and run the following command (requires node >5.6, npm, curl, make and which):

        sudo -u www-data make  # www-data might vary depending on your distribution

* Finally make sure that the **nextcloud/apps/news** directory is owned by the web server user

        sudo chown -R www-data:www-data nextcloud/apps/news  # www-data:www-data might vary depending on your distribution

* Activate the **News** app in the apps menu

## Installing from Git (development version)

### Build Dependencies
These Dependencies are only relevant if you want to build the source code:
* make
* which
* Node.js >= 6
* npm
* composer

* The master branch will always be stable in conjunction with the latest master branch from Nextcloud
* JavaScript and PHP libraries are not included anymore since 8.0.0 and will require you to run **make** after updating/installing the app
* In your terminal go into the **nextcloud/apps/** directory and then run the following command:

        git clone https://github.com/nextcloud/news.git
        cd news
        make

* If you are using a stable Nextcloud release, stay with the [latest git tag release which is running on your version](https://github.com/nextcloud/news/releases). To get an overview over all existing tags run:

        git tag

 You can switch to a release which will be supported on your installation by running:

      git checkout tags/TAG
      make  # if News version >= 8.0.0

 For instance to use the 5.2.8 release, run:

      git checkout tags/5.2.8

* Activate the **News** app in the apps menu

To update the News app use change into the **nextcloud/apps/news/** directory using your terminal and then run:

    git pull --rebase origin master
    make
