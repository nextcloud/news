# Configuration

All configuration values are set inside **nextcloud/data/news/config/config.ini** and can be edited in the admin panel.

The configuration is in **INI** format and looks like this:

```ini
autoPurgeMinimumInterval = 60
autoPurgeCount = 200
maxRedirects = 10
maxSize = 104857600
feedFetcherTimeout = 60
useCronUpdates = true
exploreUrl =
```


* **autoPurgeMinimumInterval**: Minimum amount of seconds after deleted feeds and folders are removed from the database. Values below 60 seconds are ignored
* **autoPurgeCount**: Defines the maximum amount of articles that can be read per feed which won't be deleted by the cleanup job; if old articles reappear after being read, increase this value; negative values such as -1 will turn this feature off completely
* **maxRedirects**: How many redirects the updater should follow
* **maxSize**: Maximum feed size in bytes. If the RSS/Atom page is bigger than this value, the update will be aborted
* **feedFetcherTimeout**: Maximum number of seconds to wait for an RSS or Atom feed to load. If a feed takes longer than that number of seconds to update, the update will be aborted
* **useCronUpdates**: To use a custom update/cron script you need to disable the cronjob which is run by Nextcloud by default by setting this to false
* **exploreUrl**: If given that url will be contacted for fetching content for the explore feed
