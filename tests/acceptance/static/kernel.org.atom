You may read the entire copy of the license in the <a class="reference external" href="/pub/linux/kernel/COPYING">COPYING</a> file distributed with each release of the Linux kernel.</p> </div> <div class="section" id="there-are-a-number-of-kernels-marked-as-stable-which-one-is-stable"> <h2>There are a number of kernels marked as 'stable', which one is stable?</h2> <p>There are a number of reasons there are multiple kernels marked as 'stable'. The stable series kernels stem from a <a class="reference external" href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/4100">conversation that happened in 2004</a>, it has evolved into a number of kernels that are currently being maintained under the 'stable' moniker.</p> <p>These kernels have patches that are backported to them, mainly in the form of driver updates and security fixes. Some of these trees have been declared to have longer life cycles than others.</p> <p>Please check the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kernel.org/releases.html">Releases</a> page for more info.</p> </div> <div class="section" id="what-does-stable-eol-and-longterm-mean"> <h2>What does &quot;stable/EOL&quot; and &quot;longterm&quot; mean?</h2> <p>As kernels move from the &quot;mainline&quot; into the &quot;stable&quot; category, two things can happen:</p> <ol class="arabic simple"> <li>They can reach &quot;End of Life&quot; after a few bugfix revisions, which means that kernel maintainers will release no more bugfixes for this kernel version, or</li> <li>They can be put into &quot;longterm&quot; maintenance, which means that maintainers will provide bugfixes for this kernel revision for a much longer period of time.</li> </ol> <p>If the kernel version you are using is marked &quot;EOL,&quot; you should consider upgrading to the next major version as there will be no more bugfixes provided for the kernel version you are using.</p> <p>Please check the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kernel.org/releases.html">Releases</a> page for more info.</p> </div> <div class="section" id="is-there-an-rss-feed-for-the-latest-kernel-version"> <h2>Is there an RSS feed for the latest kernel version?</h2> <p>Yes, and you can find it at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kernel.org/feeds/kdist.xml">https://www.kernel.org/feeds/kdist.xml</a>.</p> <p>We also publish a .json file with the latest release information, which you can pull from here: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kernel.org/releases.json">https://www.kernel.org/releases.json</a>.</p> </div> <div class="section" id="why-are-there-files-that-are-dated-tomorrow"> <h2>Why are there files that are dated tomorrow?</h2> <p>All timestamps on kernel.org are in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).

Kernel.org deals with the Linux kernel, various distributions of the kernel and larger repositories of packages. We do not mirror individual projects, software, etc as we feel there are better places providing mirrors for those kinds of repositories. If you feel that kernel.org should mirror your project, please contact <a class="reference external" href="mailto:ftpadmin&#64;kernel.org">ftpadmin&#64;kernel.org</a> with the following information:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>name</li> <li>project name</li> <li>project website</li> <li>detailed project description</li> <li>reason for wanting us to mirror</li> </ul> <p>The Kernel.org admin team will then review your request and talk to you about it.

I get &quot;Reversed patch detected!&quot;</h2> <p>-rc kernel patches are generated from the base stable release.</p> <p>For example: to create the 2.6.14-rc5 kernel, you must:</p> <ul class="simple"> <li>download 2.6.13 (not 2.6.13.4)</li> <li>and then apply the 2.6.14-rc5 patch.</li> </ul> <p>Yes, you want 2.6.13, not 2.6.14. Remember, that's an -rc kernel, as in, 2.6.14 doesn't exist yet. :)</p> </div> <div class="section" id="where-can-i-find-kernel-2-4-20-3-16"> <h2>Where can I find kernel 2.4.20-3.16?</h2> <p>Kernel version numbers of this form are distribution kernels, meaning they are modified kernels produced by distributions.

<div class="section" id="what-is-linux"> <h2>What is Linux?</h2> <p>Linux is a clone of the operating system Unix, written from scratch by Linus Torvalds with assistance from a loosely-knit team of hackers across the Net. It aims towards POSIX and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.unix.org/">Single UNIX Specification</a> compliance.</p> <p>It has all the features you would expect in a modern fully-fledged Unix, including true multitasking, virtual memory, shared libraries, demand loading, shared copy-on-write executables, proper memory management, and multistack networking including IPv4 and IPv6.</p> <p>Although originally developed first for 32-bit x86-based PCs (386 or higher), today Linux also runs on a multitude of other processor architectures, in both 32- and 64-bit variants.</p> </div> <div class="section" id="new-to-linux"> <h2>New to Linux?</h2> <p>If you're new to Linux, you don't want to download the kernel, which is just a component in a working Linux system. Instead, you want what is called a distribution of Linux, which is a complete Linux system. There are numerous distributions available for download on the Internet as well as for purchase from various vendors; some are general-purpose, and some are optimized for specific uses. We currently have mirrors of several distributions available at <a class="reference external" href="http://mirrors.kernel.org/">http://mirrors.kernel.org/</a>.</p> <p>Note, however, that most distributions are very large (several gigabytes), so unless you have a fast Internet link you may want to save yourself some hassle and purchase a CD-ROM with a distribution; such CD-ROMs are available from a number of vendors.</p> </div> <div class="section" id="mailing-lists"> <h2>Mailing lists</h2> <p>The Linux kernel is discussed on the linux-kernel mailing list at <a class="reference external" href="http://vger.kernel.org/">vger.kernel.org</a>.

This cryptographic signature allows anyone to verify whether the files have been modified or otherwise tampered with since the developer created and signed them. The signing and verification process uses public-key cryptography and it is next to impossible to forge a PGP signature without first gaining access to the developer's private key. If this does happen, the developers will revoke the compromised key and will re-sign all their previously signed releases with the new key.</p> <p>To learn more about the way PGP works, please consult <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy#How_PGP_encryption_works">Wikipedia</a>.</p> </div> <div class="section" id="kernel-org-web-of-trust"> <h2>Kernel.org web of trust</h2> <p>In order for this section to make sense, you should first familiarize yourself with the way PGP Web of Trust works. You can start by reading the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">Wikipedia article</a> on the subject.</p> <p>In a few words, <strong>PGP keys used by members of kernel.org are cross-signed by other members of kernel.org</strong> (and, frequently, by many other people). If you wanted to verify the validity of any key belonging to a member of kernel.org, you could review the list of signatures on their public key and then make a decision whether you trust that key or not. This article from the GnuPG manual is a good first step towards understanding how you can use PGP trust relationships to validate keys: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html#AEN385">Using trust to validate keys</a>.</p> <p>In order to become part of the kernel.org web of trust, you should locate kernel.org members in your geographical area, then verify and sign their keys. To locate members of kernel.org in your area, you can either use the <a class="reference external" href="https://j.mp/kgpgmap">Google Map</a> created for this purpose, or send an email to the <a class="reference external" href="mailto:users&#64;kernel.org">users&#64;kernel.org</a> mailing list, requesting key signing.</p> <p>Once you have verified and signed a few keys, you can use the trust relationship established in the process to verify other keys used in the kernel.org web of trust.</p> </div> <div class="section" id="using-gnupg-to-verify-kernel-signatures"> <h2>Using GnuPG to verify kernel signatures</h2> <p>All software released via kernel.org has corresponding PGP signatures. It should not be possible to upload any files to the kernel.org mirrors without providing a trusted PGP signature to go along with them.</p> <p>To better illustrate the verification process, let's use Linux 3.1.5 release as a walk-through example. First, use &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">wget</tt>&quot; or &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">curl <span class="pre">-O</span></tt>&quot; to download the release and the corresponding signature:</p> <pre class="literal-block"> $ wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.0/linux-3.1.5.tar.xz $ wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v3.0/linux-3.1.5.tar.sign </pre> <p>You will notice that the signature is made against the uncompressed version of the archive. This is done so there is only one signature required for .gz, .bz2 and .xz compressed versions of the release. Start by uncompressing the archive, using <tt class="docutils literal">unxz</tt> in our case:</p> <pre class="literal-block"> $ unxz linux-3.1.5.tar.xz </pre> <p>Now verify the .tar archive against the signature:</p> <pre class="literal-block"> $ gpg --verify linux-3.1.5.tar.sign </pre> <p>You can combine these steps into a one-liner:</p> <pre class="literal-block"> $ xz -cd linux-3.1.5.tar.xz | gpg --verify linux-3.1.5.tar.sign - </pre> <p>The likely output will be:</p> <pre class="literal-block"> gpg: Signature made Fri 09 Dec 2011 12:16:46 PM EST using RSA key ID 6092693E gpg: Can't check signature: public key not found </pre> <p>You will need to first download the public key from the PGP keyserver in order to verify the signature. Look at the first line of the output and note the &quot;key ID&quot; listed, which in our example is <tt class="docutils literal">6092693E</tt>. Now download this key from the key servers:</p> <pre class="literal-block"> $ gpg --recv-keys 6092693E gpg: requesting key 6092693E from hkp server subkeys.pgp.net gpg: key 6092693E: public key &quot;Greg Kroah-Hartman (Linux kernel stable release signing key) &lt;greg&#64;kroah.com&gt;&quot; imported gpg: 3 marginal(s) needed, 1 complete(s) needed, PGP trust model gpg: depth: 0 valid: 3 signed: 1 trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 3u gpg: depth: 1 valid: 1 signed: 0 trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 1f, 0u gpg: Total number processed: 1 gpg: imported: 1 (RSA: 1) </pre> <p>Let's rerun &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">gpg <span class="pre">--verify</span></tt>&quot;:</p> <pre class="literal-block"> $ gpg --verify linux-3.1.5.tar.sign gpg: Signature made Fri 09 Dec 2011 12:16:46 PM EST using RSA key ID 6092693E gpg: Good signature from &quot;Greg Kroah-Hartman (Linux kernel stable release signing key) &lt;greg&#64;kroah.com&gt;&quot; gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature! gpg: There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.

This will require that you first locate the members of kernel.org in your area and sign their keys. <strong>Short of meeting the actual owner of the PGP key in real life, this is your best option to verify the validity of a PGP key signature.</strong></li> <li>Review the list of signatures on the developer's key by using &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">gpg <span class="pre">--list-sigs</span></tt>&quot;. Email as many people who have signed the key as possible, preferably at different organizations (or at least different domains). Ask them to confirm that they have signed the key in question. You should attach at best marginal trust to the responses you receive in this manner (if you receive any).</li> </ol> <p>If at any time you see &quot;BAD signature&quot; output from &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">gpg <span class="pre">--verify</span></tt>&quot;, please first check that your download is correct and that the downloaded file is not truncated or otherwise corrupted. If you repeatedly get the same &quot;BAD signature&quot; output, email <a class="reference external" href="mailto:ftpadmin&#64;kernel.org">ftpadmin&#64;kernel.org</a> immediately, so we can investigate the problem.</p> </div> <div class="section" id="kernel-org-checksum-autosigner-and-sha256sums-asc"> <h2>Kernel.org checksum autosigner and sha256sums.asc</h2> <p>We have a dedicated off-the-network system that connects directly to our central attached storage and calculates checksums for all uploaded software releases.
